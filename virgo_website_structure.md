* **Mobile First:** 80% of traffic will be on phones. Ensure the "3 for £69" offer is sticky (stays visible) as they scroll on mobile.
* **Speed:** Compress all luxury videos/images so the site loads instantly.
* **Trust Signals:** Add a small "verified reviews" star rating (e.g., from Trustpilot or Google) near the "Claim Offer" button.
