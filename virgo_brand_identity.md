## 2. The Color Palette
This palette is designed to mimic natural, expensive materials: stone, clay, and precious metals. It avoids the standard "medical blue" or "spa green."

| Color Name | Hex Code | Usage Role | Psychology / Texture |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Bespoke Charcoal** | `#2C2A29` | Primary Brand Color | Used for the Logo, Main Headings, and Footer. It is softer than pure black, resembling tailored wool or deep slate. |
| **Limestone Cream** | `#F5F3EF` | Canvas / Background | The foundation of the website and printed stationery. Never use pure white (`#FFFFFF`); this cream mimics high-quality cardstock. |
| **Burnished Copper** | `#B07C5D` | Luxury Accent | Used for Icons, CTA Buttons, and thin borders. Represents skin health, clay, and warmth. |
| **Soft Taupe** | `#8A8683` | Support / Text | Used for body paragraphs and secondary details. Reduces eye strain and adds elegance. |
